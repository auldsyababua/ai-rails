# .example.env - AI Rails Environment Variables Template

# This file lists all environment variables required by the AI Rails system.
#
# IMPORTANT:
# 1. DO NOT RENAME THIS FILE TO .env AND COMMIT IT TO GIT.
#    Instead, make a copy named .env, fill it with your actual values,
#    and ensure .env is ignored by Git (it already should be in .ai-rails/.gitignore).
# 2. These variables configure communication with your self-hosted services
#    (Ollama, MCPs, n8n) running on your AI Workhorse or NAS.
#    Adjust the IP addresses and ports to match your specific deployment.

# --- LLM Service URLs ---
# Base URL for your Ollama LLM inference server.
# Default assumes Ollama is running locally or in Docker.
OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434

# ANTHROPIC_API_KEY for Claude API access.
# This specific key should ideally be managed securely by your SecretsMCP
# running on your Workhorse. You can put it here for local testing,
# but for production use, the SecretsMCP should be the source.
# ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-your-claude-api-key-here

# --- MCP Service URLs ---
# These can point to:
# 1. Our reference implementations (see docs/CUSTOM_MCP_SETUP.md)
# 2. Your own implementations
# 3. Community implementations (see docs/COMMUNITY_MCPS.md)
# 4. Local Docker containers (default)

# URL for your custom Codebase Summary MCP service.
# This MCP provides context about your project's code.
# For CodebaseSummaryMCP, see: https://github.com/colinaulds/codebase-summary-mcp (to be published)
CODEBASE_SUMMARY_MCP_URL=http://localhost:8003

# URL for your custom Secrets MCP service.
# This MCP securely manages and serves environment variables/API keys.
# For SecretsMCP, see: https://github.com/colinaulds/secrets-mcp (to be published)
SECRETS_MCP_URL=http://localhost:8004

# URL for your MCP-Sequential-Thinking service (e.g., from glama.ai).
# Provides structured reasoning and task breakdown.
MCP_SEQUENTIAL_THINKING_URL=http://localhost:8001

# URL for your Context7 service (e.g., from Upstash/GitHub for RAG).
# Provides vector-database backed context retrieval for documentation/memory.
CONTEXT7_URL=http://localhost:8002

# URL for your Brave Search or similar Web Search MCP.
# Enables agents to perform web searches for external information.
BRAVE_SEARCH_MCP_URL=http://localhost:8005

# --- Automation Service URLs ---
# Base URL for triggering your n8n workflows.
# This should point to the webhook endpoint exposed by your n8n instance.
# Default assumes n8n is running locally or accessible via Docker.
N8N_WEBHOOK_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5678/webhook/

# --- Authentication Tokens ---
# This token authenticates ai_rails_backend.py to the SecretsMCP service.
# Must match the SECRETS_MCP_AUTH_KEY configured on the AI Workhorse.
