# .example.env - AI Rails Environment Variables Template

# This file lists all environment variables required by the AI Rails system.
#
# IMPORTANT:
# 1. DO NOT RENAME THIS FILE TO .env AND COMMIT IT TO GIT.
#    Instead, make a copy named .env, fill it with your actual values,
#    and ensure .env is ignored by Git (it already should be in .ai-rails/.gitignore).
# 2. These variables configure communication with your self-hosted services
#    (Ollama, MCPs, n8n) running on your AI Workhorse or NAS.
#    Adjust the IP addresses and ports to match your specific deployment.

# --- LLM Service URLs ---
# Base URL for your Ollama LLM inference server.
# Default is for your AI Workhorse (10GbE direct link).
OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://10.0.0.2:11434

# ANTHROPIC_API_KEY for Claude API access.
# This specific key should ideally be managed securely by your SecretsMCP
# running on your Workhorse. You can put it here for local testing,
# but for production use, the SecretsMCP should be the source.
# ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-your-claude-api-key-here

# --- MCP Service URLs ---
# URL for your custom Codebase Summary MCP service.
# This MCP provides context about your project's code.

# --- Authentication Tokens ---
# This token authenticates ai_rails_backend.py to the SecretsMCP service.
