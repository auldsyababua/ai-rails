# AI Rails: Python Dependencies
# This file lists all Python packages required for the AI Rails system.
# Packages marked as 'MVP' are essential for core functionality and the initial UI.
# Packages marked as 'LONG-TERM' are for future enhancements and are commented out.

# --- MVP Dependencies ---

# FastAPI: Primary web framework for the backend UI and API endpoints.
# Provides a clean and modern way to build RESTful services.
fastapi==0.111.0

# Uvicorn: ASGI server to run FastAPI applications.
uvicorn==0.30.1

# Requests: HTTP client for making API calls to Ollama and custom MCPs on the Workhorse.
requests==2.32.3

# Ollama Python Client: For programmatic interaction with the Ollama server API.
ollama==0.1.7

# Python Markdown: For rendering Markdown content from agent outputs in the UI.
markdown==3.6

# PyYAML: Useful for parsing YAML-based configurations or data if needed,
# though not strictly in the current MVP design, it's very common.
# Consider for structured prompt loading.
pyyaml==6.0.1

# python-dotenv: For securely loading environment variables (e.g., API keys) in the backend.
# Crucial for local development and SecretsMCP interaction.
python-dotenv==1.0.1

# --- LONG-TERM Dependencies (Commented Out) ---

# Redis Client (e.g., redis-py): For agent state management and caching.
# Required if implementing Redis support for conversation history.
# # redis==5.0.1

# Vector Database Client (e.g., chromadb or qdrant-client):
# For advanced CodebaseSummaryMCP or other knowledge-based MCPs
# that use vector embeddings for RAG.
# # chromadb==0.5.0
# # qdrant-client==1.9.0

# Prometheus Client: For exposing application metrics from the backend UI/MCPs.
# Part of the observability stack.
# # prometheus_client==0.20.0

# Python JSON Logger: For structured logging (e.g., JSONL format)
# that can be easily parsed by log aggregation systems.
# # python-json-logger==2.0.7

# HTTPX: A more modern asynchronous HTTP client, alternative to 'requests'.
# Might be preferred for performance in a truly async FastAPI app long-term.
# # httpx==0.27.0

# Psutil: For monitoring system resources on the Mac Mini (control plane)
# if the UI needs to display local resource usage.
# # psutil==5.9.8

# Flask (if chosen over FastAPI later, or for simpler MCPs):
# # flask==3.0.3
# # Jinja2 (if using Flask for server-side templating beyond HTMX/Alpine.js):
# # jinja2==3.1.4

# Diff Match Patch (for advanced diffing in UI):
# # diff-match-patch==20230430
