## Key Changes Summary

### Architecture Changes
- SecretsMCP now supports project-scoped secrets with fallback
- No breaking changes - all additions are backwards compatible
- Personal configuration layer separate from public repository

### Security Enhancements
- Project isolation for API keys
- Authentication required for all SecretsMCP requests
- Sensitive secrets require explicit human approval

### Developer Experience
- Comprehensive documentation for all features
- Helper scripts for common tasks
- Mock services for easy testing
- Infrastructure-agnostic defaults

### Testing
- All changes include appropriate tests
- test_secrets_flow.py updated with project context tests
- Mock services enable testing without real infrastructure

## Review Focus Areas

1. **Security**: Review authentication flow in call_mcp.py
2. **Documentation**: Ensure all guides are clear and complete
3. **Compatibility**: Verify no breaking changes to existing workflow
4. **Best Practices**: Check Python code follows standards
5. **Git Hygiene**: Confirm sensitive data patterns in .gitignore

## Notes for Reviewer

- All changes maintain backwards compatibility
- The system can be used with or without project contexts
