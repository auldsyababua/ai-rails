// This is the primary definition of your AI agent. It sets the overarching role,
// purpose, and fundamental "personality" of the agent.
// - **[Agent Name]:** Replace this with the specific, descriptive name of your agent (e.g., "Planning Agent", "Coder Agent", "Unit Tester Agent").
// - **Core Persona Description:** Write a detailed, compelling description of what this agent is.
//   Think about:
//   - Its expertise (e.g., "expert Software Engineer", "meticulous Technical Writer").
