# Takeover Project Kickoff: [Project Name / Codebase Identifier]

## Project Overview:
[Provide a brief, high-level description of what this existing project is supposed to do. What's its main purpose or domain?]

## Initial Goals / Why are you taking this over?:
[What do you hope to achieve by taking over this project? (e.g., finish incomplete features, refactor for performance, add a new major module, simply understand it for maintenance).]

## Available Codebase Access & Entry Points:
[Describe how the Planner Agent can "access" the codebase for its analysis. Since Claude Code has file system access, this is where you'd list relevant directories or file patterns you'll provide to it.
Example:
- The entire repository will be provided to Claude Code via file context.
- Key directories: `src/`, `lib/`, `config/`, `database/`
- Primary entry points: `index.js`, `main.py`, `app.rb`
- Known major frameworks/technologies: (e.g., React, Node.js Express, Python Flask, PostgreSQL, Docker)
]

## Known Issues or Ambiguities (Optional):
[Are there any known bugs, unfinished features, or areas of the codebase that are particularly confusing or problematic?]

## Specific Areas for Initial Assessment:
[What specific aspects of the codebase do you want the Planner Agent to focus on during its initial review?
Example:
- Overall architecture and design patterns
- Dependency management (e.g., package.json, requirements.txt)
- Build/deployment process
- Testing strategy (or lack thereof)
- Database schema and ORM usage
- API endpoints and their structure
- Core business logic flows
]

## Desired Outcome of Takeover Kickoff:
[What do you want the Planner Agent's "Research & Planning Document" to contain for this takeover?
Example:
- High-level architectural overview (ASCII diagram preferred if possible)
- Identification of key components and their responsibilities
- Assessment of code quality and maintainability (with examples)
- Identification of technical debt and potential risks
- Proposed initial roadmap for takeover and future development
- Suggestions for initial documentation needs
