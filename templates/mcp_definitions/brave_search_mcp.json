    "Planning Agent": "When you need to research new technologies, market trends, or common architectural patterns that are not in your internal knowledge base, use BraveSearchMCP. Formulate a precise 'search_query' to get relevant external context.",
    "Coder Agent": "If you encounter a challenging coding problem, an unfamiliar error message, or need to find diverse coding examples for a specific pattern, use this MCP to perform a web search. Be as specific as possible in your 'search_query'.",
    "Unit Tester Agent": "When generating tests that require understanding external libraries or complex behaviors not immediately obvious, use BraveSearchMCP to find documentation or examples. Use a focused 'search_query' to get the most relevant test insights.",
    "Debugger Agent": "For unfamiliar error messages, obscure bug symptoms, or to find common solutions/workarounds for known issues, use BraveSearchMCP. Provide the error message or symptoms as your 'search_query'.",
    "Documentation Agent": "To research general technical concepts, industry standards, or to find examples of how other projects document similar features, use BraveSearchMCP to enrich your documentation content. Aim for clear and concise 'search_query' values.",
    "Code Review Agent": "If you are reviewing code that implements an unfamiliar algorithm, uses a less common library, or potentially contains a known vulnerability, use BraveSearchMCP to quickly find relevant information or security advisories by searching for 'CVE-[year]-[number]' or similar.",
    "Refactor Agent": "When considering alternative design patterns or refactoring strategies, use BraveSearchMCP to research industry best practices, performance implications, or comparative analysis of different approaches.",
    "n8n Flow Creator Agent": "If you need to find documentation for a specific n8n node, or examples of common n8n workflows for a given integration (e.g., 'n8n webhook to Notion integration example'), use BraveSearchMCP."
